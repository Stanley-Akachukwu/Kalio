1. $select:
http://localhost:5093/employee?$select=firstname,salary

2. $filter:
The $filter filters data based on a boolean condition. The following are conditional operators that have to be used in 'URLs':
eq- equals to
ne - not equals to
gt -greater than
ge - greater than or equal
lt - less than
le - less than or equal

http://localhost:5093/employee?$filter=salary eq 19000

3. $orderby:
http://localhost:5093/employee?$orderby=id desc

4. $skip:
The $skip skips the specified number of records and fetches the remaining data
http://localhost:5093/employee?$skip=2


5. $top:
The $top fetches specified the count of top records in the collection. so to work this operator, we must specify an extension method like 'SetMaxTo(specify_max_number)'.
http://localhost:5093/employee?$top=2

6. $expand:
Using $expand we can query the internal or navigating property object. So we have to assign the navigation property name to the '$expand' then we can apply all other operations like '$select', '$filter', '$skip' on the navigation property type.
http://localhost:5093/Employee?$expand=EmployeeAddresses($select=Id, city)

7. $count:
